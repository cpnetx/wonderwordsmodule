# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
since version 2.

## [3.0.0] - Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- This version officially supports Python 3.8+
- The command-line interface has changed. Shell scripts relying on
  Wonderwords need to be updated

### Added

- Speed improvements when using `starts_with` and `ends_with`
- More efficient batch operations and regular expression compilation
- Idiomatic CLI commands
- Profanity filtering
- Support for custom ``Random`` objects and determinism when running
  with a specific seed.

### Fixed

- Fixes and updates to word lists
- Fixed bug where ``return_less_if_necessary`` would produce result
  in incorrect filtering

### Removed

- Dropped support for Python 3.6 and 3.7
- No more dependency on ``importlib_resources``

## [2.2.0] - 2021-02-17

### Added

- Added `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added custom word categories.
- The Rich library is now an optional dependency.
- Bumped dependency version numbers.
- Added a list of profanities.
- Refactored code.
- Removed profanities by default.
- Added singular forms of categories as default such as "noun" instead of
  "nouns".

### Changed

- Changed the implementation behind the scenes. Now, word lists are loaded once
  and reused between instances of the `RandomWord` class. This is more
  efficient.
- Changed the implementation of `RandomSentence` to make up for the changes in
  `RandomWord`.
- `RandomWord.parts_of_speech` will soon be deprecated.
- The `include_parts_of_speech` argument for RandomWord methods will soon be
  deprecated. The alternative is now `include_categories`.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-09-11

### Added

- Added the regex word matcher for both the CLI and the `RandomWord` class.
- Added "Prerequisites" section to the install page.
- Added sphinx-copybutton to the documentation so that it is easy to copy code
  snippets.

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect code snippet in docstring.
- Fixed broken link in documentation.


## [2.0.1] - 2020-09-10

### Fixed

- Added dependencies to `setup.py` (somehow completely forgot), fixing the
  dependency issue.
- Fixed incorrect commands in the CLI documentation.
- Fixed broken link in the CLI.


## [2.0.0] - 2020-09-09

### Changed

## [2.0.0-alpha] - 2020-09-09

  - The `word` method to generate a random word.
- The `RandomSentence` method to generate random sentences (same as

- A documentation on Readthedocs.

### Changed
- Changed the command line interface to be more efficient and styled it with the
  help of Rich.

### Removed
- The `random_word` class (wasn't pep 8 compliant, older functionality was

  class.
